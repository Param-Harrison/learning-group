# Who can learn this
Anyone who is really interested to become a <b>data scientist</b> or <b>machine learning engineer</b>. Check the Reality for more information :blush:

### Reality
- People who understood concepts in Mathematics
  - Probability (Bayes theorem, Dice problems)
  - Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Distribution)
  - Linear Algebra (Vectors, Matrix)
- People who have experience in Database & Visualization of Data
- People who live to do analytics on everything they think and want to automate stuff in real life :sweat_smile:
- People who are passionate to experience new things
- People who want to go beyond themselves (Tamil: riskelam engaluku rusk sapdamathiri) :joy:
- People who have lot of patience and determination for atleast 1 to 1 and half years to attain productive level skills
