Learning path are the actual <b>Matrix Degree</b> program

### Beginners Plan :baby:
- [ML for Beginners](https://github.com/Param-Harrison/thematrixML/blob/master/ML-for-beginners.md)

### Intermediate Plan :boy:
- [ML for Programmers](https://github.com/Param-Harrison/thematrixML/blob/master/ML-for-programmers.md)

### Advanced Plan :man:
- [ML for Developers](https://github.com/Param-Harrison/thematrixML/blob/master/ML-for-developers.md)

# Who can learn this
Anyone who is really interested to become a <b>data scientist</b> or <b>machine learning engineer</b>. Check the Reality for more information :blush:

### Reality
- People who understood concepts in Mathematics
  - Probability (Bayes theorem, Dice problems)
  - Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Distribution)
  - Linear Algebra (Vectors, Matrix)
- People who have experience in Database & Visualization of Data
- People who live to do analytics on everything they think and want to automate stuff in real life :sweat_smile:
- People who are passionate to experience new things
- People who want to go beyond themselves (Tamil: riskelam engaluku rusk sapdamathiri :joy:)
- People who have lot of patience and determination for atleast 1 to 1 and half years to attain productive level skills

### Is it preffered for a career change?
- <b>NO</b> is my ideal answer. But its all depends on your will power
- If you have a stable job and want to enhance your skill set in a more free way (around next 2 years), <b>YES</b>, this course is for you
- I would recommend more easier path first to change your career and then pursue this, since this is become more and more complicated once we enter into hardcore mathematical world 
- Other options I would recommend are,
  - Front end development
  - Backend development
  - Mobile development
  - UI/UX designer

### Where can we get free curriculum / study plan for other technologies like mobile development etc.?
- We are working on it. Will update very soon :pray:
